Balanced Brackets

Placeholder problem description:
- Add the exact problem statement here (from your course or platform).
- Add input/output format and constraints.

Suggested structure:
- implement `solve` which takes input from standard input and prints required output.

Example stub implementation provided — adapt or replace with your own solution.
